Touch device and control method thereof. A touch device and a control method thereof are provided. In the control method, a sensing signal generated by a sensor is received. When an operating object is present, a touch screen is configured for touchable regions and untouchable regions, wherein the untouchable regions cannot generate a response through a touch by the operating object. A gesture is received on the untouchable regions of the touch screen, a processor determines whether the gesture is conformed to a default gesture setting, and the processor decides whether or not to adjust part or all of the untouchable regions to the touchable regions according to the determining result.
