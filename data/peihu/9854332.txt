Interactive content acquisition using embedded codes. Methods and devices are provided to facilitate acquisition of information associated with a multimedia content through embedded watermarks. One such method includes obtaining a server code for embedding into a content. The server code identifies a particular domain name registered to a registrant entity and provides a mapping to an Internet address of a metadata server. Upon receiving an indication that a trigger event is associated with a particular segment of the content, a first watermark payload is formed and embedded in the content. The watermark payload includes the server code, an interval code and a first trigger value. The interval code identifies the particular content segment and the first trigger value indicates that additional information associated with the particular segment is. Detection of the first trigger value from a subsequently distributed content enables a query to the metadata server for acquisition of metadata.
