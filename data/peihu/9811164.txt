Radar-based gesture sensing and data transmission. This document describes techniques and devices for radar-based gesture sensing and data transmission. The techniques enable, through a radar system, seamless and intuitive control of, and data transmission between, computing devices. This radar system can both transmit data and sense gestures, thereby performing with a single system, control of many devices and data transmission with those devices. Not only can this provide control of many devices, from refrigerators to laptops, this radar system also allows high-bandwidth data transmission between devices.
