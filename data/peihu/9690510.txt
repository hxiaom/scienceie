Two-stage read/write 3D architecture for memory devices. Some embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a memory device wherein a single memory cell array is partitioned between two or more tiers which are vertically integrated on a single substrate. The memory device also includes support circuitry including a control circuit configured to read and write data to the memory cells on each tier, and a shared input/output (I/O) architecture which is connected the memory cells within each tier and configured to receive input data word prior to a write operation, and further configured to provide output data word after a read operation. Other devices and methods are also disclosed.
