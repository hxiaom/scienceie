Wall mounting-type flexible display. The present invention relates to a wall mounting-type flexible display, which can be mounted on a wall, the display comprising: a display panel having a bending portion having a bent peripheral area; a support bar for supporting the display panel by being in contact with the bending portion; and a bracket coupled to the support bar and fixed to a wall surface, wherein the bending portion of the display panel comprises at least two curved surfaces having at least one inflection point, and the first and second curved surfaces, which are adjacent to each other about the inflection point, may have different curvatures. The first curved surface is directly adjacent to the end portion of the display panel, the second curved surface is adjacent to the first curved surface while being spaced from the end portion of the display panel, and the curvature of the first curved surface may be larger than the curvature of the second curved surface.
