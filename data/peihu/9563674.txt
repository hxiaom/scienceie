Data exploration user interface. A data exploration user interface includes a selection area with selectable representations of queryable fields of a data source and a visualization area where query results are displayed as data visualizations. Queries are generated by dragging fields from the selectable area to the visualization area of the user interface. A tree structure of data visualizations may be created by dragging data points out of a displayed visualization and applying additional fields to create a new query and resulting visualization. The tree structure is graphically represented with path indicators that provide historical context for each new data visualization within the visualization are of the user interface.
