Integrated learning using multiple devices. An access code can be generated by a primary device and interpreted by a secondary device for the purpose of presenting, on the secondary device, additional content related to an application running on the primary device. The access code can be a two dimensional graphic or QR code that can be easily captured by a camera unit of the secondary device. Once captured, additional content related to the running application can be identified and displayed on the secondary device.
