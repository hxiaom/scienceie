Transporting apparatus and printing apparatus including the same. Transporting apparatus includes a transporting section configured to transport continuous-form paper, an imaging apparatus including a light applying section for emitting light toward the continuous-form paper, and an imaging element for taking images of continuous-form paper based on the light from the light applying section, a transportation amount computing section configured to compute the transportation amount of the continuous-form paper based on the images of the continuous-form paper, and a transporting control section configured to control the transporting section based on the transportation amount. The imaging element includes a valid pixel area including a plurality of pixels where electric charge can be accumulated in accordance with the light reflected on the continuous-form paper, and a shading area including a plurality of pixels where the reflected light can be shaded. The light applying section emits light within a duration of reading a pixel signal of the shading area.
