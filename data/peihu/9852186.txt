Managing risk with continuous queries. Techniques for managing risks with continuous queries are provided. In some examples, a selection of a data object enabled to provide a real-time stream of business event data may be received. The selection may be received by a user associated with the business event data. Additionally, a continuous query language query may be generated. The query may be configured to monitor the real-time stream of business event data for a first metric. In some examples, the a risk indicator associated with a second metric that affects the first metric may be identified. Output events of a pre-existing continuous query language query may be listened to. Further, a real-time visualization of the first metric and/or the second metric may be provided.
