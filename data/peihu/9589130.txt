Application trust-listing security service. Provided are techniques for controlling access to computing resources comprising generating a first fingerprint corresponding to a first executable file; storing the fingerprint in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium; receiving a request to execute a second executable file on a computing system; generating a second fingerprint corresponding to the second executable file; determining whether or not the first fingerprint matches the second fingerprint; and, in response to determining that the first and second fingerprints match, executing the executable file on the computing system; and, in response to determining that the first and second fingerprints do not match, preventing the executable file from executing on the computing system.
