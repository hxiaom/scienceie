Print orientation of documents based on device sensor output. This is directed to defining the orientation in which a document is printed from the orientation of the device on which the document is displayed. In particular, some electronic devices can have limited user interfaces that do not provide for a simple or elegant interface for defining print settings. To overcome limitations in a displayed user interface, the orientation of an electronic device can be used to define the print orientation of a displayed document. In particular, a motion-sensing component of an electronic device can determine whether the electronic device display is in a portrait or landscape orientation, and define the page orientation of the displayed document to match the determined device orientation. The electronic device can then transmit the document, in the defined page orientation, to a printer system for printing in the desired page orientation.
