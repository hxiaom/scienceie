Predicting future translations. Technology is disclosed for snippet pre-translation and dynamic selection of translation systems. Pre-translation uses snippet attributes such as characteristics of a snippet author, snippet topics, snippet context, expected snippet viewers, etc., to predict how many translation requests for the snippet are likely to be received. An appropriate translator can be dynamically selected to produce a translation of a snippet either as a result of the snippet being selected for pre-translation or from another trigger, such as a user requesting a translation of the snippet. Different translators can generate high quality translations after a period of time or other translators can generate lower quality translations earlier. Dynamic selection of translators involves dynamically selecting machine or human translation, e.g., based on a quality of translation that is desired. Translations can be improved over time by employing better machine or human translators, such as when a snippet is identified as being more popular.
