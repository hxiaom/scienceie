Entry/exit architecture for protected device modules. The entry/exit architecture may be a critical component of a protection framework using a secure enclaves-like trust framework for coprocessors. The entry/exit architecture describes steps that may be used to switch securely into a trusted execution environment (entry architecture) and out of the trusted execution environment (exit architecture), at the same time preventing any secure information from leaking to an untrusted environment.
