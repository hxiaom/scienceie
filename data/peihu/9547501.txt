Information processing apparatus, storage control apparatus, and computer-readable recording medium having stored program. The information processing apparatus includes a first device which is managed by a first OS, a second device which is managed by a second OS, and a processing unit. The processing unit causes the first OS and the second OS, the first OS to load a first maintenance driver corresponding to the first device, the first maintenance driver to perform maintenance control of the first device, the first OS to load a second maintenance driver corresponding to the second device, and the second maintenance driver to perform maintenance control of the second device. Therefore, it is possible to efficiently achieve the maintenance control of a plurality of devices, each of which is managed by a plurality of operating systems.
