Automatic column resizing. In various embodiments, methods, systems, and non-transitory computer-readable media are disclosed that allow developers to provide automatic column resizing in spreadsheet software using a desktop integration framework. The width of a column usually can only be set at or to hard-wired widths or manually adjusted to fit (even with a manually triggered auto adjustment function). This feature adds the ability to control column widths in tables at run time.
