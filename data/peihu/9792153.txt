Computing resource inventory system. Systems and methods of managing computing resources of a computing system are described. A computing resource list and computing resource information may be stored at a data store. The computing resource list may identify a set of computing resources of a computing system, and the computing resource information may respectively describe the computing resources. The computing resource list may be updated in response to a new computing resource being added to the computing system or in response to an existing computing resource being removed from the computing system. Evaluation tasks for the computing resources may be performed, and a resource evaluation report may be generated during performance of at least one of the evaluation task.
