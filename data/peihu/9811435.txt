System for virtual machine risk monitoring. A virtual machine may allow execution of applications decoupled from physical hardware. The virtual machine may be executed by the physical hardware in a data center. A system can monitor and assess performance and reliability of the virtual machine based on device records of network components of the data center that are supporting operation of the virtual machine.
