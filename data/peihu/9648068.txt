Partitionable unifiers in distributed streaming platform for real-time applications. Software for a distributed streaming platform receives an application that runs on a streaming platform. The application is structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with operators as nodes and streams as edges between nodes. The application includes an operator that receives a plurality of values, counts the values that are unique, and emits the unique values in a stream. The software partitions the operator into at least two partitioned instances. Then the software assigns a unique value emitting from a partitioned instance to one of a plurality of unifiers according to a pre-defined scheme. Each unifier creates a count of the unique values received by the unifier. Then the software transmits the counts from each of the unifiers to a downstream instance of an operator that aggregates the counts into a sum. And the software displays the sum in a graphical user interface (GUI).
