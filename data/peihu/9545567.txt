Apparatus and method for manipulating a virtual world by utilizing biometric information. An apparatus and method for processing a virtual world. According to certain embodiments of the present disclosure, real-world biometric information on the user may be collected using a bio sensor, and the collected information may be controlled based on the sensor characteristics of the bio sensor, thereby enabling interaction between the real world and the virtual world, as well as between virtual worlds. In addition, an interactive game which is executed in the virtual world on the basis of the collected biometric information may be controlled to thereby produce a virtual world having enhanced realism. Moreover, the real-world health status of a user may be determined and displayed on the basis of the collected biometric information, thereby enabling the health status of the user to be seen.
