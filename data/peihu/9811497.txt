Memory extension system and method. A memory extension system and method are provided. The system includes a processor, an extended memory, an extended chip, and multiple processor installation positions, where a memory installation position is provided in each processor installation position; the multiple processor installation positions are connected through a QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) interface, the processor is installed in at least one processor installation position, and at least one of the other processor installation positions is used as an extended installation position; the extended chip is installed in at least one extended installation position; and the extended memory is installed in a memory installation position. In this memory extension system, an extended chip is installed in another processor installation position, so that an existing processor can access an extended memory of the extended chip by using the extended chip. Thereby, a memory capacity of the existing processor increases while a processing capability does not increase.
