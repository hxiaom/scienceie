Network advertising system. Systems and methods for transmitting content to a client via a communication network are provided. According to one embodiment, an insertion server running within a firewall device of a network observes a content request of an application protocol by monitoring or proxying transport communication protocol connections established through the firewall device. The content request is (i) originated by a client device coupled to the network, (ii) directed to a destination device coupled to the network and (iii) associated with one of the multiple transport communication protocol connections. Responsive to observing the content request, the insertion server determines whether one or more conditions are satisfied. If so, the content request is negated by causing a canceling message of the transport communication protocol to be sent to the destination device and unsolicited content is selected and delivered to the client device via the application protocol.
