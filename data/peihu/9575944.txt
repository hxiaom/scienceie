Directional navigation of page content. A system and method for displaying and navigating through structured content, such as a webpage, is provided. The content includes focusable elements, at least one of which is a non-enableable element that is normally not capable of gaining focus when the content is displayed in a browser or other viewing application. Navigation of the content by moving focus from one element to another includes moving the focus to the focusable, non-enableable element. The non-enableable element is defined as a focusable element by an attribute. Focusable elements may also be defined with attributes for capturing directional navigation instructions and calling event handling functions in response to detected directional navigation instructions.
