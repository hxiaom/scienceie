Set partitioning for encoding file system allocation metadata. Methods for encoding file system metadata are described herein. According to one embodiment, a file system cache is maintained including information representing relationships between inodes and disk blocks of a disk having disk sections. Each disk section includes a data segment and a header encoding metadata for describing the data section of each disk section. The metadata is encoded using a set partitioning algorithm and each set represents a set of disk blocks. In response to a file system request for reading a disk section, metadata associated with the disk section is retrieved and decoded to extract information representing a relationship between inodes and disk blocks associated with the requested disk section. The file system request is then serviced using the decoded metadata and the associated data segment and one or more entries of the file system cache are updated using the decoded metadata.
