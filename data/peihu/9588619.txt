Performance monitoring and correction in a touch-sensitive apparatus. Touch sensitivity is enabled using a touch system that comprises a panel configured to conduct signals, e.g. by TIR, along detection lines across a touch surface. A signal processor operates in a sequence of repetitions to: generate data samples that represent detected signal energy on the actual detection lines; generate based on the data samples, an interpolated sinogram comprising interpolation samples that represent fictitious detection lines which have a desired location on the touch surface; and reconstruct a signal interaction pattern for the touch surface based on the interpolated sinogram. The signal processor implements an error correction to counteract the influence of a change in validity status for a data sample among the data samples, by identifying interpolation samples affected by the change in validity status, and by setting each identified interpolation sample to a value that maintains a relative signal transmission of the fictitious detection line from a former repetition.
