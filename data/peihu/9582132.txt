System for interactive help. Method and system for the provision of interactive assistance over a network for a user to complete a desired computing task on a user computing device. Task-guides are generated on task-guide generators operating on author user devices. Each task-guide includes a sequence of processes, each process including an action for the user to perform in association with a graphical user interface (GUI) object displayed on the user computing device. The process obtains information about the GUI object using at least one data-gathering technique. An administrator operating on a server computing device receives a task-assistance request from a task-guide executor operating on an end user device, and sends back at least one suitable task-guide over the network. The task-guide executor executes the task-guide on the end user device, displaying a sequence of instructions for the end user to follow in order to complete the desired computing task.
