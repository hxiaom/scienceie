Managing virtual machines according to network bandwidth. A processor-implemented method manages virtual machines that execute on physical servers in a server cloud. One or more processors establish a maximum network bandwidth percentage for a physical server in the server cloud. The maximum network bandwidth percentage is a percentage of a total network bandwidth capability designed for the first physical server. Response time for operational requests to one or more virtual machines on the first physical server changes beyond a predefined differential in response to the maximum network bandwidth percentage being reached. In response to the NIC controller device on the first physical server determining that the maximum network bandwidth percentage for the first physical server is exceeded, a cloud service hypervisor device moves one or more virtual machines on the first physical server to a second physical server in the server cloud.
