Software-defined storage system monitoring tool. Methods, computing systems and computer program products implement embodiments of the present invention that include collecting, from a software-defined storage system including one or more computing nodes that are configured to provide a storage service, performance metrics for each of the computing nodes, and detecting, based on the performance metrics, a performance bottleneck in the software-defined storage system. In embodiments of the present invention, each of the computing nodes includes one or more software modules and one or more hardware components, and the performance bottleneck is either a given software module or a given hardware component. In some embodiments, detecting the performance bottleneck includes predicting the performance bottleneck. Upon detecting the performance bottleneck, a solution for the performance bottleneck can be determined, and the performance bottleneck and the solution can be presented to a user on a display.
