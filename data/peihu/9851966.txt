Data processing systems and communications systems and methods for integrating privacy compliance systems with software development and agile tools for privacy design. Data processing systems and methods for: (1) receiving, via privacy data compliance software, from a first set of users, respective answers for question/answer pairings regarding the proposed design of a product; (2) using the question/answer pairings to prepare an initial privacy impact assessment for the product; (3) displaying, via the privacy data compliance software, the plurality of question/answer pairings to a second set of users, and receiving recommended steps to be implemented, before the product's implementation date, as part of the design of the product; (4) initiating the generation of one or more tasks in project management software that would advance the completion of the recommended steps; and (5) after the tasks have been completed, generating, by the privacy data compliance software, an updated privacy impact assessment for the product that reflects the fact that the tasks have been completed.
