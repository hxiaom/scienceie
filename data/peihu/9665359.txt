Automatically resolving conflicts after installation of selected updates in a computer system. An update installer generates an update display for a user that allows the user to select updates to be applied to a computer system. Conflicts that arise because of application of the updates to the computer system are automatically resolved and the results of the conflict resolution are displayed.
