Reuse of problematic disks in a redundant disk system. A problematic disk within a Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) data storage system can be reused. A first disk within the RAID data storage system can be formatted, initialized, and validated in response to the first disk experiencing a recoverable data storage error. The first disk can be designated as a second-level redundant disk within the RAID data storage system in order for the RAID data storage system to access the first disk in response to success of the validating operation on the first disk. Problematic disks experiencing media errors and/or slow disk errors can be isolated from the RAID data storage system to ensure high reliability of the RAID system.
