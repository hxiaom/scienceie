Memory management for finite automata processing. Matching at least one regular expression pattern in an input stream may be optimized by initializing a search context in a run stack based on (i) partial match results determined from walking segments of a payload of a flow through a first finite automation and (ii) a historical search context associated with the flow. The search context may be modified via push or pop operations to direct at least one processor to walk segments of the payload through the at least one second finite automation. The search context may be maintained in a manner that obviates overflow of the search context and obviating stalling of the push or pop operations to increase match performance.
