Compilation for node device GPU-based parallel processing. An apparatus may include a processor and storage to store instructions that cause the processor to perform operations including: in response to a determination that a GPU of a node device is available, determine whether a task routine can be compiled to generate a GPU task routine for execution by the GPU to cause performance of multiple instances of a task of the task routine at least partially in parallel without dependencies thereamong; and in response to a determination that the task routine is able to be compiled to generate the GPU task routine: employ a conversion rule to convert the task routine into the GPU task routine; compile the GPU task routine for execution by the GPU; and assign performance of the task with a data set partition to the node device to enable performance of the multiple instances with the data set partition by the GPU.
