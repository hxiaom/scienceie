Managing data storage in a set of storage systems using usage counters. The present invention relates to a method for data access in a storage infrastructure. The storage infrastructure comprises a host system connected to at least a first storage system and a second storage system. The first storage system receives, from the host system, a write request for storing a data chunk, the write request is indicative of a first identifier of the data chunk. The first storage system calculates a hash value of the received data chunk using a hash function. The first storage system determines a first storage location in the first storage system of the data chunk and sends a write message including the hash value, the first identifier and the first storage location to the de-duplication module. The de-duplication module determines whether the hash value exists in the data structure.
