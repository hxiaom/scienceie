Abnormality detection method for vehicle body tilt control device. An abnormality detection method for a vehicle body tilt control device makes it possible to determine which air spring has an air supply/exhaust abnormality. A model creation step prepares a state estimation model for each of the front and rear vehicle halves into which a vehicle is divided, and an abnormality detection step applies a state estimation technique to the state estimation model to detect which one of the air springs has an air supply/exhaust abnormality. When flow rate command values for air supplied to/exhausted from the air springs included in each vehicle half are input, each of the input flow rate command values for air supplied to/exhausted from the air springs is multiplied by a virtual gain and the results are averaged. Based on the averages, the average of the heights of the air springs is output, where each virtual gain is included as a state variable.
