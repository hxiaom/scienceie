Qualification of match results. Qualification of data matches can be improved relative to existing approaches by use of first, second, and third similarity criteria, which can be used to identify a set of near match record pairs, identify a set of actual match record pairs and to flag as near matches those record pairs of the set of near matches that were identified as actual matches, and to identify and flag one or more suspect matches.
