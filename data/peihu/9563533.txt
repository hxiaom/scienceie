Maintaining coherent synchronization between data streams on detection of overflow. Trace data streams are generated for tracing target processor activity. Various trace data streams are synchronized using markers called sync points. The sync points provide a unique identifier field and a context to the data that will follow it. All trace data streams may generate a sync point with this unique identifier. These unique identifiers allow synchronization between multiple trace data streams. When multiple trace data streams are on, it is possible that the data input rate may be higher than the data output rate. If synchronization is lost in such a case, there must be a scheme to resynchronize the streams. This invention is a technique for this needed resynchronization.
