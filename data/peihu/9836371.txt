User-directed logging and auto-correction. A method, system, and computer program product for performing user-initiated logging and auto-correction in hardware/software systems. Embodiments commence upon identifying a set of test points and respective instrumentation components, then determining logging capabilities of the instrumentation components. The nature and extent of the capabilities and configuration of the components aid in generating labels to describe the various logging capabilities. The labels are then used in a user interface so as to obtain user-configurable settings which are also used in determining auto-correction actions. A measurement taken at a testpoint may result in detection of an occurrence of a certain condition, and auto-correction steps can be taken by retrieving a rulebase comprising a set of conditions corresponding to one or more measurements, and corrective actions corresponding to the one or more conditions. Detection of a condition can automatically invoke any number of processes to apply a corrective action and/or emit a recommendation.
