Tracking large numbers of moving objects in an event processing system. Techniques for tracking large numbers of moving objects in an event processing system are provided. An input event stream can be received, where the events in the input event stream represent the movement of a plurality of geometries or objects. The input event stream can then be partitioned among a number of processing nodes of the event processing system, thereby enabling parallel processing of one or more continuous queries for tracking the objects. The partitioning can be performed such that each processing node is configured to track objects in a predefined spatial region, and the spatial regions for at least two nodes overlap. This overlapping window enables a single node to find, e.g., all of the objects within a particular distance of a target object, even if the target object is in the process of moving from the region of that node to the overlapping region of another node.
