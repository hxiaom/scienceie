Head movement controlled navigation among multiple boards for display in a headset computer. To assist with hands-free computing, the Head Mounted Display or Headset Computer utilizes a series of user configurable Home Pages that contain the shortcuts and widgets the user wants and one or more head movements. This allows the user to design a user interface environment which gives desired information, in the desired order.
