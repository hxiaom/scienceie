Information processing method and electronic device. An information processing method and an electronic device comprising a touch sensitive unit and a display unit separated from each other are described. The electronic device includes at least a first display mode, and a second display mode suitable for the touch sensitive unit. The method includes acquiring a third display mode of the display unit at a first timing when the electronic device is turned on; detecting whether the third display mode is the second display mode or not; acquiring coordinates of each point of N points of the display unit and generating a first control instruction, when the third display mode is the second display mode, wherein N is an integer above 2; and performing the first control instruction, to correspond the coordinates of the each point of the N points to coordinates of each touch sensitive point of the touch sensitive unit.
