Accessing operating system elements via a tag cloud. Providing access to an element in an operating system executed by a processor includes: with the processor, tracking behavior of a user with respect to multiple elements managed by the operating system; displaying a tag cloud to the user with a display device, the tag cloud having multiple objects, each of the objects representing one of the elements managed by the operating system and having a size based on the tracked behavior of the user with respect to the element managed by the operating system; and allowing, with the processor, the user to access at least one of the elements using the tag cloud.
