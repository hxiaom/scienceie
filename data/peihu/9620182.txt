Pulse mechanism for memory circuit interruption. In a memory system where multiple memory chips communicate their ready/busy status on a shared bus line, a pulse mechanism is used for the individual memory chips to indicate their ready/busy status to the controller. In one example, the controller assigns pulse durations of differing lengths to the memory dies to allow the controller to distinguish between them. Techniques for dealing with bus collisions between the pulses of different chips are also described.
