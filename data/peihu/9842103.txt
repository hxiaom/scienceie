Machined book detection. A system and method for determining whether a textual work submitted for publishing is machine generated or non-machine generated by identifying and quantifying various aspects of the textual work and comparing those aspects to known works. For example, the system and method may identify aspects of a textual work, including, a relationship between the sentences within the textual work, a writing style of the author of the textual work, a grammatical structure of the sentences within the textual work, a quality of the textual work, and other aspects of the textual work. Upon determining that the textual work is machine generated the textual work may be rejected for publishing.
