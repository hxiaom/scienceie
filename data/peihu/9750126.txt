Electronic device with combination heat sink/blower or fan assembly having air duct. An electronic device includes a circuit board having heat generating components thereon. A heat sink with air current generating electric device assembly lies over the circuit board, through which heat from the circuit board and the components thereon is dispersed. The assembly includes a heat sink having a solid central core and a plurality of fins protruding from the core. An air current generating electric device is disposed over the heat sink and having an air intake facing a top of the heat sink and an exhaust opening directed parallel to a plane of the circuit board. An air duct extends from the exhaust opening of the air current generating electric device to exhaust apertures on at least one side wall of the electronic device.
