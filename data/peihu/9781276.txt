Reliably communicating information associated with mobile device accounts. A computing platform enables the reliable delivery of message data (e.g., virtual airtime credits) into the accounts of mobile device users. The computing platform facilitates a large network of integrations (communication channels) with mobile network operators and reseller, preferably via a statistically-based message routing technique that uses a continuously updated estimate of the probability that a particular request over each integration will succeed. Requests are then routed over an integration picked using this information; if the request fails, the attempt is then retried using another integration until either it succeeds or the system believes the request will never succeed. The success or failure of each request is also used to update the probability estimate, preferably continuously, so that the system adjusts automatically as the reliability of each integration changes over time.
