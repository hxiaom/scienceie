Relative placement of volume partitions. A system and method for providing sets of partition placements, the system and method including determining a first set of placements for a first set of partitions first set of partitions of a volume based at least in part on a set of constraints, and placing the first set of partitions based at least in part on the first set of placements. The system and method further includes determining a second set of placements for a second set of partitions of the volume based at least in part on the first set of placements and the set of constraints, the second set of partitions being a replica of the first set of partitions, and placing the second set of partitions based at least in part on the second set of placements.
