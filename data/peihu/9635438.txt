Providing secondary content to accompany a primary content item. While a user views a primary content item (for example, a movie on a television screen), secondary content items are selected and presented to the user, either on the same screen or on a screen of the user's companion device. To choose selections that are relevant to the user's current interests, the selection process considers information beyond the realm of primary and secondary content. Over time, the selection process learns to make more relevant selections by monitoring selection choices made by other systems.
