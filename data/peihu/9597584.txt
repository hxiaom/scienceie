Determining real-world effects from games. A game system in which virtual representations of real-world, physical objects may be designed or modified by game players within a virtual game universe. Real-world physical interactions of the virtual objects may be simulated by a game engine during game play within the game universe. Performance data may be collected for the virtual objects that simulates real-world performance data for corresponding physical objects. The performance data for the virtual objects may, for example, be used in evaluating performance of modifications to a physical object, or for comparing performance of two or more physical objects. Production or manufacturing decisions for respective physical objects may be made at least in part based on the performance data collected for the virtual representations of the objects.
