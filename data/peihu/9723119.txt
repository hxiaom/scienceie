Reduction of haptic noise feedback in system. An information handling system has a haptic generation module to generate haptic effects including haptic noise and a haptic noise reduction module. The haptic noise reduction module receives characteristics of sound representative of haptic noise generated by a haptic generation module of a device and entering an audio input module of the device, the characteristics including frequencies and timing. It also detects the generation of haptic effects, the generations occurring after the receiving characteristics. It also reduces the effects of haptic noise on digital data representing audio input to the device based upon the received characteristics of the sound. It may reduce the effects by subtracting amplitudes of audio waves representing the haptic noise from amplitudes of audio waves representing the audio input.
