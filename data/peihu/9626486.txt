Patient health care network guided encounter. In an environment where it is beneficial for chronic health care patients to receive individualized attention on a daily basis, a health care network (<b>10</b>) is provided. Each patient receives a user interface device (<b>12</b>) such as a set top box for accessing the network (<b>10</b>). Based on the patient's health care history, a nurse or other health care professional interfaces with a server (<b>22</b>) and constructs a care plan specific to that patient by filling out appropriate sections of a care plan template. An itinerary arrangement processor (<b>32</b>) organizes content gleaned from the patient's care plan and constructs a serially arranged itinerary for the patient to experience each day. The patient logs on to the network (<b>10</b>) and is immediately presented with the day's itinerary, without having to navigate any menus. Resultantly, the patient will have an easier experience, and will not miss any material.
