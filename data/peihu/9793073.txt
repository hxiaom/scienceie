Backlighting a fabric enclosure of a flexible cover. Fabric enclosure backlighting techniques are described. In one or more implementations, one or more translucent portions are formed within a plurality of layers of a fabric enclosure assembly. In one approach, regions within one or multiple layers are laser etched to form the translucent portions within the fabric enclosure assembly. A light source is then arranged to selectively transmit light through the layers via the translucent portions to provide backlight for one or more elements integrated with fabric enclosure assembly. The one or more elements may include representations of input keys and/or graphics associated with the fabric enclosure assembly. The backlight may be used to view the one or more elements in low light and/or provide backlight effects such as borders, side lighting, labels, and so forth.
