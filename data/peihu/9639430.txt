Intermediate data backup in an incremental snapshot data backup system to reduce data backup time. Machines, systems and methods for performing intermediate data backups, the method comprising monitoring data updates to one or more data blocks in at least a target data storage medium, wherein the target data storage medium is subject to an incremental data backup routine at prescheduled time intervals; in response to determining that said at least one or more data blocks is updated prior to a prescheduled time interval for the incremental data backup routine, performing one or more intermediate data backups to store data from the updated data blocks to at least one backup data storage medium; and in response to determining that said at least one or more data blocks is updated prior to the prescheduled time interval for the incremental data backup routine but after the last of the intermediate data backups, copying data on one or more updated data blocks after the last of the intermediate data backups to the backup data storage medium.
