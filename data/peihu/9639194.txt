In-cell touch display structure. An in-cell touch display structure includes: an upper substrate, a lower substrate, a display material layer configured between the upper and lower substrates, and a thin film transistor and sensing electrode layer. The thin film transistor and sensing electrode layer includes a gate line sub-layer having a plurality of gate lines and a plurality of connection segments separated by the gate lines, and a source line sub-layer having a plurality of source lines, a plurality of sensing conductor lines, and a plurality of sensing conductor segments separated by the source lines and the sensing conductor lines, wherein part of the sensing conductor segments and part of the connection segments are electrically connected together to form a plurality of sensing conductor blocks.
