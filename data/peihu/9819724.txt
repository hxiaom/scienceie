XML communication. A distributed system includes a client and a server. The client may comprise a serialization module for serializing data into a first communication format to communicate the data to a server. The server may include a communication format parser for de-serializing the data received into a server-internal communication format. The serialization module may also be adapted for transforming the data into the server-internal communication format for a communication to the server. The client may also be adapted for indicating to the server that the client is capable of sending data in the server-internal communication format, and the server may be able to indicate its readiness to receive such data. The data may be sent either in the first or, alternatively, in the server-internal format.
