Integrated circuit containing first and second DOEs of standard cell compatible, NCEM-enabled fill cells, with the first DOE including tip-to-tip short configured fill cells, and the second DOE including corner short configured fill cells. An IC includes first and second designs of experiments (DOEs), each comprised of at least two fill cells. The fill cells contain structures configured to obtain in-line data via non-contact electrical measurements (&#x201c;NCEM&#x201d;). The first DOE contains fill cells configured to enable non-contact (NC) detection of tip-to-tip shorts, and the second DOE contains fill cells configured to enable NC detection of corner shorts.
