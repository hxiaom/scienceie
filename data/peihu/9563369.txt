Fine-grained bandwidth provisioning in a memory controller. Systems and methods for applying a fine-grained QoS logic are provided. The system may include a memory controller, the memory controller configured to receive memory access requests from a plurality of masters via a bus fabric. The memory controller determines the priority class of each of the plurality of masters, and further determines the amount of memory data bus bandwidth consumed by each master on the memory data bus. Based on the priority class assigned to each of the masters and the amount of memory data bus bandwidth consumed by each master, the memory controller applies a fine-grained QoS logic to compute a schedule for the memory requests. Based on this schedule, the memory controller converts the memory requests to memory commands, sends the memory commands to a memory device via a memory command bus, and receives a response from the memory device via a memory data bus.
