Analyzing language dependency structures. Technology is discussed herein for identifying trending actions within a group of posts matching a query. A group of posts can be selected based on specified actions, action targets, or parameters such as author age, location, gender, when the posts were posted or what keywords they contain. Selected posts can be divided into sentences and a dependency structure can be created for each sentence classifying portions of the sentence as actions or action targets. Statistics can be generated for each sentence or post indicating whether it matches the actions, action targets, or other parameters specified in the query. Based on these statistics, additional information can be gathered to respond to questions posed in the query.
