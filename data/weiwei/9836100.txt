Support frame with integrated phase change material for thermal management. The invention is directed to a novel solution to providing heat management and cooling to electronic devices. According to various embodiments, heat produced during the operation of the processing components in the computing device is absorbed by heat management features integrated within a supporting mid-frame. The heat management features include phase changing materials that allow the processing components to be kept at a isothermal state through changes in phase, thereby prolonging the duration of time in which the processing components can operate at high performance levels without the need to throttle the performance.
