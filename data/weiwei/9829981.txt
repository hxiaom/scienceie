Haptic output device. A haptic actuator is disclosed. The haptic actuator comprises a magnet, a conductor set apart from the magnet by a gap, and an actuator coupled to the magnet. The actuator is configured to move the magnet between a first position in which the conductor is subjected to, from the magnet, a first net magnetic flux having a first direction, and a second position in which the conductor is subjected to, from the magnet, a second net magnetic flux having a second direction different than the first direction.
