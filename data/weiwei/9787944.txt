Transmission terminal, transmission method, and computer-readable recording medium storing transmission program. A transmission terminal transmits video data and display data of a screen shared with another transmission terminal to the other transmission terminal via a predetermined relay apparatus. The transmission terminal includes a storage unit that stores relay apparatus information of the relay apparatus to which the transmission terminal transmits the video data; a receive unit that receives the display data from an external input apparatus connected to the transmission terminal; and a transmitting unit that transmits the display data received by the receive unit to the relay apparatus indicated by the relay apparatus information stored in the storage unit.
