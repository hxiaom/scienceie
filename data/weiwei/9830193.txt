Automatic management of low latency computational capacity. A system for providing automatic management of low latency computational capacity is provided. The system may be configured to maintain a plurality of virtual machine instances. The system may be further configured to identify a trend in incoming code execution requests to execute program code on a virtual compute system, determine, based on the identified trend, that the plurality of virtual machine instances should be adjusted, and adjust the plurality of virtual machine instances based on the identified trend.
