Calbration of a sensor assembly for use in medical position/orientation tracking. A position and orientation system and method is provided. A magnetoresistance sensor is provided having a sensor array configured to measure magnetic fields and a metallic coil positioned within the magnetoresistance sensor. In certain embodiments, the magnetic coil may be used to generate a known magnetic field that, when measured by the sensor array, may be used to determine or update a calibration constant for the system.
