Maintaining and updating file system shadows on a local device by a synchronization client of a cloud-based platform. Systems and methods for maintaining and updating file system shadows by a synchronization client of a cloud-based platform. In some embodiments, an executor of the synchronization client can execute an action on an item in the local file system which changes the state of the item from an old state to a new state. The synchronization client updates the file system shadows with the new state of the item via an interface to facilitate generation of a synchronization event for the change to the item, that would otherwise go undetected if the change to the item was immediately reversed. In some embodiments, methods for providing shadow consistency and enhancing concurrent access to shadows are implemented by the synchronization client in maintaining and updating the file system shadows.
