Peoplesoft cloud manager. A method and system for promoting software code from a source database instance to a target database instance distributed amongst a plurality of networked servers is described. Software code migration information pertaining to software objects associated with the software code, the source database instance, and the target database instance is analyzed to determine whether errors associated with migrating the software code exceeds a predefined acceptance threshold. Such code migration information is further analyzed to determine whether migrating the software code from the source database instance to the target database instance will result in unacceptable data loss including disassociation, deletion, or change to data, or result in unacceptable non-data criteria before, during, or after the software code is migrated.
