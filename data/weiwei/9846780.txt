Automated vulnerability intelligence generation and application. Techniques for providing computer security vulnerability intelligence are disclosed. The techniques include obtaining distributable vulnerability data that includes, for each of a plurality of software packages and associated vulnerabilities, threat mitigation information and a threat priority parameter, where the distributable vulnerability data was derived from an intelligence graph including a plurality of fundamental instance nodes, a plurality of document nodes, and a plurality of edges. The techniques also include identifying installed software packages on a computer system, correlating a plurality of the installed software packages with the distributable vulnerability data to obtain a plurality of installed software packages and associated vulnerabilities, ordering at least some of the plurality of installed software packages and associated vulnerabilities according to threat priority parameters, such that an ordered plurality of installed software packages and associated vulnerabilities is obtained, and providing mitigation information for the ordered plurality of installed software packages and associated vulnerabilities.
