Method of animating messages. The present invention relates to rendering texts in a natural language, namely to manipulating a text in a natural language to generate an image or animation corresponding to this text. The invention is unique mainly in that a sequence of animations is selected, semantically corresponding to a given text. Given a set of animations and a text, the invention makes it possible to compare the sequence of these animations to this text. It is unique in that text templates are used and an optimum sequence of these templates is determined. The idea of the template-based text rendering consists in that the text is manipulated to generate an image or animation with the aid of searching correspondences to a limited number of predefined templates. An animation according to certain style is selected in compliance with each template. Animations are sequentially combined into a single sequence of video images.
