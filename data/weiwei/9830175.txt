Predictive management of on-demand code execution. Systems and methods are described for predictively managing calls to tasks on an on-demand code execution environment. Specifically, a task profile can be utilized to predict that a call to a task will be followed by transmission of information to an auxiliary service. Thereafter, the on-demand code execution environment can select a virtual machine to execute the task based, for example, on the speed or reliability of a communication channel between the selected virtual machine and the auxiliary service. If execution of the task does cause transmission of information to the auxiliary service, the information can be transmitted via the communication channel, thereby increasing the speed or reliability of the transmission.
