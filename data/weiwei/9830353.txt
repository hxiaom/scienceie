Determining match type for query tokens. Example processes for determining a match type include: receiving a query token from a content provider; consulting a database stored in memory to determine past performance of the query token for associated content, where the past performance includes performance information indicating how well the query token performed for different match types, where a match type indicates a way that components of the query token match components of another query token in order to achieve a token match; determining, based on the performance information, differences in performance between ones of the different match types; comparing the differences in performance to a threshold; and selecting a match type for the query token based on the comparing.
