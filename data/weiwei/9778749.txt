Occluded gesture recognition. This document describes techniques and devices for occluded gesture recognition. Through use of the techniques and devices described herein, users may control their devices even when a user's gesture is occluded by some material between the user's hands and the device itself. Thus, the techniques enable users to control their mobile devices in many situations in which control is desired but conventional techniques do permit effective control, such as when a user's mobile computing device is occluded by being in a purse, bag, pocket, or even in another room.
