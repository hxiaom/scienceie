Cache management techniques. Described are techniques for caching metadata. At least a portion of the cached metadata may be stored persistently on flash-based storage. A data movement granularity size may be determined in accordance with one or more values including M denoting a number of storage units, or more generally metadata objects, having associated metadata stored in a single cached metadata page. At least a portion of the associated metadata is stored on the flash-based storage. A first data portion selected for data movement may have a size equal to the data movement granularity size. The first data portion has first metadata stored on the flash-based storage. The first metadata may include location metadata updated in connection with data movements performed. In accordance with data movement of the first data portion, the first metadata is updated. In a single write operation, the updated first metadata may be written to the flash-based storage.
