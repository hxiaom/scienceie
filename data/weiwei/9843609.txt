Creation, sharing and embedding of interactive charts. Systems and methods for generating and sharing interactive charts are described. The interactive charts are generated in an online portal that allows users to customize the interactive features of the chart. An online portal may also be provided to allow users to automatically embed interactive chart(s) in another website without reprogramming the code of the website each time the interactive chart(s) are changed or new interactive chart(s) are added.
