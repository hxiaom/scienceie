Default playback device designation. Systems and methods discussed herein involve designating a default playback device in a local playback network. One method may involve determining that a networked microphone device is available for assignment to one or more playback zones within a local playback network, displaying a prompt to indicate at least one playback zone to which the network microphone device is to be assigned, receiving an input indicating a particular playback zone in the local playback system to which the network microphone device is to be assigned, and storing data indicating an assignment of the network microphone device to the particular playback zone.
