Devices and methods for processing touch inputs with instructions in a web page. An electronic device, while displaying a user interface that corresponds to at least a portion of a web page on a display, detects a touch input on a touch-sensitive surface at a first location that corresponds to the displayed portion of the web page on the display. While detecting the touch input on the touch-sensitive surface, the electronic device detects an intensity of the touch input on the touch-sensitive surface, determines whether the intensity of the touch input on the touch-sensitive surface has changed from below a first intensity threshold to above the first intensity threshold, and in response to determining that the intensity of the touch input on the touch-sensitive surface has changed from below the first intensity threshold to above the first intensity threshold, generates a force down event that is distinct from a mouse down event.
