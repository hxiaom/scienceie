Low-loss tunable radio frequency filter. A method of constructing an RF filter comprises designing an RF filter that includes a plurality of resonant elements disposed, a plurality of non-resonant elements coupling the resonant elements together to form a stop band having a plurality of transmission zeroes corresponding to respective frequencies of the resonant elements, and a sub-band between the transmission zeroes. The non-resonant elements comprise a variable non-resonant element for selectively introducing a reflection zero within the stop band to create a pass band in the sub-band. The method further comprises changing the order in which the resonant elements are disposed along the signal transmission path to create a plurality of filter solutions, computing a performance parameter for each of the filter solutions, comparing the performance parameters to each other, selecting one of the filter solutions based on the comparison of the computed performance parameters, and constructing the RF filter using the selected filter solution.
