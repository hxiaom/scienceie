Safety scheme for gesture-based game. Technologies are generally described for providing a notification to a player playing a gesture-based game of a potentially dangerous condition. In some examples, a safety component of a gesture-based game system includes a gesture range determination unit configured to determine a gesture range associated with a gesture-based game; a detection unit configured to detect a movement of an object; and an alarm unit configured to generate an alarm in response to a determination based on the movement of the object which is within the gesture range.
