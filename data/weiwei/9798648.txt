Transitive source code violation matching and attribution. Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on computer storage media, for matching and attributing code violations. One of the methods includes receiving a plurality of snapshots of a code base, including data representing a revision graph of the snapshots of the code base and data representing respective violations in each of the plurality of snapshots. A plurality of transitively matched violations in the code base are generated, wherein each transitively matched violation represents a respective sequence of matching violations from a first violation of a first snapshot to a second violation of a second snapshot, wherein each transitively matched violation identifies a respective first violation representing an initial occurrence of a coding defect in the code base and a respective second violation representing a last occurrence of the coding defect in the code base.
