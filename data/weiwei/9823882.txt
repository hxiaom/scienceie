Semiconductor device and information processing device. In a semiconductor device in which components to be a basic configuration unit are arranged in an array shape for calculating an interaction model, a technique capable of changing a topology between the components is provided. A semiconductor device includes a plurality of units each of which includes a first memory cell for storing a value indicating a state of one node of an interaction model, a second memory cell for storing an interaction coefficient indicating an interaction from a node connected to the one node, and a calculation circuit for determining a value indicating a next state of the one node based on a value indicating a state of the connected node and on the interaction coefficient. In addition, the semiconductor device includes a plurality of switches for connecting or disconnecting the plurality of units to/from each other.
