Routing based request correlation. Aspects of the disclosure will be described with regard to the processing of DNS queries by a DNS service based on multiple network addresses associated with a single network entity (e.g., a service provider). The DNS service may respond to each DNS query for identifying network addresses associated with the service provider with a respective unique network address from a pool of network addresses. Based on the uniqueness of network addresses, DNS queries and subsequent communications between respective client computing devices and the service can be correlated.
