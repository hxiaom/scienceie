Display device including touch sensor and manufacturing method thereof. The present disclosure relates to a display device including a touch sensor and a manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly, to a display device including a touch sensor using a piezoelectric material and a manufacturing method thereof. The display device includes a first substrate, wherein a plurality of thin film transistors are disposed on the first substrate; a second substrate disposed facing the first substrate; a plurality of piezoelectric elements disposed on the second substrate; and a first sensing electrode overlapping the piezoelectric elements, the first sensing electrode being configured to transfer a sensing voltage generated as a result of pressure applied to the piezoelectric elements.
