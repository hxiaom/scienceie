Desktop application for access and interaction with workspaces in a cloud-based content management system and synchronization mechanisms thereof. Systems and methods for synchronizing workspaces in a web-based collaboration environment with local folders on computers of collaborators of the workspaces are disclosed. Collaborators of a workspace can edit copies of work items either at the collaboration environment server or at the computer. Updates to all synchronized folders are automatically performed. Conflicts between edits made by different collaborators to the same file are flagged, and a notification is sent to the author attempting to make edits to a version of a file that has already been updated by another collaborator.
