Subscriber based protection system. A system features one or more network devices communicatively coupled to a management system. Configured to receive a portion of the network traffic, a first network device features one or more virtual machines that, based on a subscribed protection level, (i) perform network activities in response to a processing of the received portion of the analyzed network traffic, (ii) monitor behaviors of the one or more virtual machines during processing of the portion of the analyzed network traffic, (iii) determine whether the behaviors are anomalous, and (iv) generate an identifier for the portion of the analyzed network traffic associated with monitored behaviors being anomalous. The management system controls a setting of the protection level for the first network device to alter a frequency of receipt of identifiers associated with analyzed network traffic from a second network device of the one or more network devices different from the first network device.
