Secure key management for roaming protected content. Content on a device is encrypted and protected based on a data protection key corresponding to a particular identity of the user of the device. The protected content can then be stored to cloud storage, and from the cloud storage the protected content can be transferred to various other ones of the user's devices. A data protection key that is used to retrieve the plaintext content from the protected content is maintained by the user's device. This data protection key can be securely transferred to other of the user's devices, allowing any of the user's devices to access the protected content.
