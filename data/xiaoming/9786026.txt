Asynchronous translation of computer program resources in graphics processing unit emulation. Resource processing during run time can be performed asynchronously from emulation of an application by a central processing unit. For example, an emulator can include a main processing thread that performs emulation processes. In response to encountering a shader, or other resource, to be processed, the emulator can invoke a separate asynchronous thread to perform such processing. Processed resources, such as translated shaders and generated textures, can be stored in a cache. In response to a command that uses a resource, such as a draw command that invokes a shader or other resource, the emulator can use the processed resource in the cache. If the processed resource is not in the cache, the emulator can skip processing the command that uses the resource. If processed resources can be obtained from other sources and loaded in the cache, processing of resources by the emulator can be eliminated.
