Using classified text and deep learning algorithms to identify drafting risks in a document and provide early warning. Deep learning is used to identify a potential risk that a contract will be unenforceable due to a drafting error whereby one or more terms or phrases are ambiguous. The system involves mining and using existing classifications of data (e.g., from a litigation database) to train one or more deep learning algorithms, and then examining the internal electronic drafts of contracts with the trained algorithm, to generate a scored output that will enable enterprise personnel to be alerted to the ambiguity risks and take action in time to prevent the risks from resulting in harm to the enterprise.
