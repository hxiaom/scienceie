Room-corrected voice detection. A playback device may have a network interface configured to communicate with a network microphone device over a communication network. A processor of the playback device may comprise instructions, which when executed, cause the processor to obtain acoustics of an environment in which the playback device is located; identify a network microphone device; and send the acoustics to the network microphone device to cause the network microphone device to apply the acoustics to voice input received by the network microphone device.
