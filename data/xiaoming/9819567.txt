Traffic surge management for points of presence. A system, method, and computer-readable medium for point of presence (POP) based traffic surge detection and mitigation are provided. The system detects a traffic surge for a target group of resources directed at a source POP based on the target group's rank shifts and volume changes among recent time intervals. The system mitigates the detected traffic surge by identifying destination POPs with spare capacity and routing at least a portion of incoming requests for the target group of resources to the destination POPs in accordance with their spare capacities.
