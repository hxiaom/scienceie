Level-shifting latch. A level-shifting latch circuit for coupling a first circuit in a first voltage domain with a second circuit in a second voltage domain, includes an input node to receive an input signal provided by the first circuit, and an output node to output a level-shifted signal, corresponding with the input signal. The level-shifting latch circuit also includes a first latch, having a first node and a second node, for storing the input signal in the first voltage domain, and a second latch, having a third node and a fourth node, for storing the input signal in the second voltage domain. In addition, the level-shifting circuit also includes a first switching element which provides a path to transfer a low voltage at the first node to the third node, and a second switching element which provides a path to transfer a low voltage at the second node to the fourth node.
