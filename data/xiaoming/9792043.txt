Methods and systems for efficiently storing data. Methods and systems for a networked storage environment are provided. One method includes scanning a first data structure by a processor executing instructions out of a memory for a storage operating system to determine whether any data chunk of a first object stored at a first storage tier is referenced by the storage operating; when the storage operating system references a certain number of data chunks, the processor using an object staging data structure to identify a second object that is in the process of being built with space for transferring the certain number of data chunks from the first object to the second object; and updating information regarding the second object at a transfer log with location information of the certain number of data chunks at the first storage tier.
