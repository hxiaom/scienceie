Power management method for determining an upper limit on a load current. There is provided a power management device including a load current control unit configured to set an upper limit on a load current supplied from a connected feeding device and to control the load current on the basis of the upper limit, and a determination unit configured to, when the load current control unit has reset the upper limit to a higher value, determine if the upper limit has exceeded a current capacity of the feeding device on the basis of a voltage drop level of an input voltage. The load current control unit may reset the upper limit in increments or decrements of a predetermined value, and the load current control unit may, when the determination unit has determined that the upper limit had exceeded the current capacity of the feeding device, control the load current by resetting the upper limit to a value not exceeding the current capacity.
