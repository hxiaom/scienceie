Bioinformatic processing systems and methods. The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for facilitating trusted handling of genomic and/or other bioinformatic information. Certain embodiments may facilitate policy-based governance of access to and/or use of bioinformatic information, improved interaction with and/or use of distributed bioinformatic information, parallelization of various processes involving bioinformatic information, and/or reduced user involvement in bioinformatic workflow processes, and/or the like. Further embodiments may provide for memoization processes that may persistently store final and/or intermediate results of computations performed using genomic data for use in connection with future computations.
