See-through computer display systems. Embodiments include a head-worn display including a display panel sized and positioned to produce a field of view to present digital content to an eye of a user, and a processor adapted to present the digital content to the display panel such that the digital content is only presented in a portion of the field of view, the portion being in the middle of the field of view such that horizontally opposing edges of the field of view are blank areas. The processor is adapted to shift the digital content into one of the blank areas to adjust the convergence distance of the digital content and thereby change the perceived distance from the user to the digital content.
