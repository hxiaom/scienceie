Apparatus and method for automatically activating a camera application based on detecting an intent to capture a photograph or a video. A method of automatically activating a camera application implemented in a mobile device in locked mode starts with the processor receiving a first signal from an accelerometer. The device's processor activates the camera application when the processor determines that the mobile device has remained in a stationary portrait or landscape position for a period of time based on the first signal. Activating the camera application includes signaling by the processor to the display device to display a camera screen from a locked screen. The processor may also receive a second signal from a proximity sensor that detects presence of a nearby object to the mobile device. When the processor determines that there is presence of the nearby object to the mobile device based on the second signal, the mobile device remains in locked mode and the processor does not activate the camera application.
