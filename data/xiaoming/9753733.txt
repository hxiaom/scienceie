Methods, apparatus, and processors for packing multiple iterations of loop in a loop buffer. Methods, apparatuses, and processors for packing multiple iterations of a loop in a loop buffer. A loop candidate that meets the criteria for buffering is detected in the instruction stream being executed by a processor. When the loop is being written to the loop buffer and the end of the loop is detected, another iteration of the loop is written to the loop buffer if the loop buffer is not yet halfway full. In this way, short loops are written to the loop buffer multiple times to maximize the instruction operations per cycle throughput out of the loop buffer when the processor is in loop buffer mode.
