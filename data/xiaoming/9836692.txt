Implementing neural networks in fixed point arithmetic computing systems. Methods, systems, and computer storage media for implementing neural networks in fixed point arithmetic computing systems. In one aspect, a method includes the actions of receiving a request to process a neural network using a processing system that performs neural network computations using fixed point arithmetic; for each node of each layer of the neural network, determining a respective scaling value for the node from the respective set of floating point weight values for the node; and converting each floating point weight value of the node into a corresponding fixed point weight value using the respective scaling value for the node to generate a set of fixed point weight values for the node; and providing the sets of fixed point floating point weight values for the nodes to the processing system for use in processing inputs using the neural network.
