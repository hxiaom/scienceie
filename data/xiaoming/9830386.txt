Determining trending topics in social media. Technology is discussed herein for identifying comparatively trending topics between groups of posts. Groups of posts can be selected based on parameters such as author age, location, gender, etc., or based on information about content items such as when they were posted or what keywords they contain. Topics, as one or more groups of words, can each be given a rank score for each group based on the topic's frequency within each group. A difference score for selected topics can be computed based on a difference between the rank score for the selected topic in each of the groups. When the difference score for a selected topic is above a specified threshold, that selected topic can be identified as a comparatively trending topic.
