Electronic device including spaced apart hall effect sensor based haptic actuator driving and related methods. An electronic device may include a haptic actuator that includes an actuator housing, coils carried within the actuator housing, and a field member movable within the actuator housing responsive to the coils. The haptic actuator may also include spaced apart Hall Effect sensors carried within the actuator housing between the coils and for sensing a temperature of the field member. The electronic device may also include a controller coupled to the haptic actuator and configured to determine a temperature of the field member based upon the spaced apart Hall Effect sensors and drive the haptic actuator based upon the temperature.
