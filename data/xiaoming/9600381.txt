Scalable transcoding for streaming audio. Systems and techniques for capturing audio and delivering the audio in digital streaming media formats are disclosed. Several aspects of the systems and techniques operate in a cloud computing environment where computational power is allocated, utilized, and paid for entirely on demand. The systems and techniques enable a call to be made directly from a virtual machine out to a Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) via a common Session Interface Protocol (SIP) to PSTN Breakout service, and the audio to be delivered onward to one or more Content Delivery Network (CDN). An audio call capture interface is also provided to initiate and manage the digital streaming media formats.
