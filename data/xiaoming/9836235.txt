Low power distributed memory network. A digital signal processing (DSP) system includes an analog to digital converter, program random access memory (PRAM), N switching devices, and a control module. The analog to digital converter is configured to convert samples of an analog signal into digital samples. The PRAM includes: N PRAM blocks, where N is an integer greater than one; and code for M digital signal processing functions stored in the N PRAM blocks, where M is an integer greater than one. The N switching devices are configured to connect and disconnect the N PRAM blocks, respectively, to and from a power source. The control module is configured to: control the N switching devices; and execute selected ones of the M digital signal processing functions on the digital samples to produce an output.
