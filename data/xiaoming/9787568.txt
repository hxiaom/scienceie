Physiological test credit method. A physiological test credit method determines if test credits are available to the monitor and checks if a Wi-Fi connection is available. If test credits are less than a test credit threshold, the monitor connects to a test credit server, processes server commands so as to download test credits and disconnects from the server. In various embodiments, the monitor is challenged to break a server code, the server is challenged to break a monitor code. The server validates monitor serial codes, and saves monitor configuration parameters.
