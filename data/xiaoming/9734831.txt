Utilizing voice biometrics. Methods, systems, computer-readable media, and apparatuses for utilizing voice biometrics to prevent unauthorized access are presented. In some embodiments, a computing device may receive a voice sample. Subsequently, the computing device may determine a voice biometric confidence score based on the voice sample. The computing device then may evaluate the voice biometric confidence score in combination with one or more other factors to identify an attempt to access an account without authorization.
