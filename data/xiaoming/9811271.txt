Migration of data storage. An operable mechanism implements a stub utility to facilitate the migration of stub files, where the stub utility is integrated with a data storage product and a data storage technique of an existing storage site containing the stub files. The stub utility identifies the stub files and uses virtualization to migrate the stub files to a new storage site without concomitantly recalling or accessing source files linked to the stub files.
