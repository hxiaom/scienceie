Display panel and method for forming an array substrate of a display panel. The present disclosure provides a display panel and a method for forming an array substrate of a display panel. The display panel includes an array substrate which includes a display region and a frame region. The frame region includes a wire region in which first signal wires are formed. Each of the first signal wires includes a first conductive layer and a second conductive layer which are stacked with each other and electrically connected. As such, to obtain the same resistance value as that in prior art, the first signal wires in the present disclosure can be formed with a reduced width. Therefore, the wire region of the array substrate can have a smaller size, and thus the whole frame region of the display panel can be smaller.
