Client-premise resource control via provider-defined interfaces. Methods and apparatus for client-premise resource control using provider-defined interfaces are described. A set of programmatic interfaces enabling clients to submit registration requests is implemented. A registration request indicates resources located at a data center external to a provider network as candidate targets for control operation requests issued via a different set of programmatic interfaces associated with a service of the provider network. A network connection is established between a particular resource indicated in a registration request, and an administrative resource located within a data center of the provider network. In response to a particular control operation request received via a programmatic interface of the different set, a control command is transmitted from the administrative resource to the particular resource via the network connection.
