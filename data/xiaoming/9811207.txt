Array substrate, in-cell touch screen and display device. The present disclosure provides an array substrate, an in-cell touch screen and a display device. The array substrate includes a plurality of touch electrodes arranged at an identical layer and separated from each other, and a plurality of wires arranged at a layer different from the touch electrodes and configured to connect the touch electrodes to a touch detection circuit. A difference in overlapping areas between each touch electrode and the wires corresponding to the other touch electrodes in a coverage region of the touch electrode is less than a predetermined threshold.
