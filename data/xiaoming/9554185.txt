Supporting multiple attention-based, user-interaction modes. The present invention monitors a user's activities to determine how much attention he is paying to one or more devices. Based on the information gathered about the user's current &#x201c;attention profile,&#x201d; a &#x201c;user-interaction parameter&#x201d; is set that reflects where the user's attention is focused and, ideally, how much of his attention is given to each device. Then, based on the user-interaction parameter, the user interface of at least one of the user's devices is configured to optimize the user's interactions, given the amount of attention he is currently giving to this user interface. If the user is giving the majority of his attention to the television, for example, then the user interface of a companion device can be configured to emphasize the types of interactions available to a user who is not actively watching the companion device.
