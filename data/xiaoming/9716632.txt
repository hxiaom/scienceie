Interactive layered visualization of a layered software architecture. A system to generate an interactive layered visualization of a software system includes a storage device to storage a model of the system that defines entities and relationships among entities. The system also includes a visualization tool to generate nodes representing the entities and assign nodes to layers in a set of ordered layers in accordance with rules associated with each layer. A layered layout of the software system is thereby generated and an interactive visualization of the layered layout is rendered for display to the user.
