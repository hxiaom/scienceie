Tiering data between two deduplication devices. In one aspect, a method includes moving metadata from a memory of a first deduplication device to a disk of the first deduplication device, moving the data related to the metadata or portions of the data to a second deduplication device, deleting the data from the first deduplication device and adding a pointer to the metadata at the first deduplication device indicating where the data is in the second deduplication device.
