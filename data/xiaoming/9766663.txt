Hinge for component attachment. A hinge for component attachment is described. In at least some implementations, a kickstand is rotatably attached to a mobile computing device. The kickstand can be rotated to various positions to provide support for different orientations of the computing device. In at least some implementations, hinges are employed to attach a kickstand to a mobile computing device. One example hinge utilizes preset hinge stops that enable the kickstand to be placed at different preset positions. Another example hinge exerts pressure on an edge of the kickstand, providing stability and vibration dampening to the kickstand.
