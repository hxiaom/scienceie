Devices, systems and methods for locating and interacting with medicament delivery systems. In some embodiments, a method includes establishing a communications link between a computing device and an adapter. The adapter is configured to receive at least a portion of a medicament delivery device. A wireless signal is received to maintain the communications link. A relative position between the computing device and the adapter is determined. An alarm is produced when the wireless signal is not received within a time period. The alarm is based on the relative position between the computing device and the adapter.
