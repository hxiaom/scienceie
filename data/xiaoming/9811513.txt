Annotation structure type determination. Methods, systems, and articles of manufacture for organizing and selecting structures used to generate forms for capturing information as annotations made for a variety of different type data objects are provided. Some embodiments allow annotation structures to be associated with specific pairings of data object types and user roles via entries in a configuration file. When a user selects a set of one or more data objects for annotation, the configuration file may be accessed to determine a proper annotation structure for use in generating an annotation form based on the selected data objects and a role of the user.
