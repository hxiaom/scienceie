Service gallery user interface presentation. A gallery user interface element that includes multiple selectable service user interface elements. Each of the selectable service user interface elements, when selected, initiates a corresponding predetermined action. Thus, the gallery may be used to initiate any number of predetermined actions by selecting appropriate service user interface elements. The predetermined actions may be performed by a number of user interface elements that are collectively offered by a variety of different applications, application extensions, or the system itself. The predetermined actions may include at least one predetermined action that extends an extendible canvas with one or more additional user interface elements. The gallery may include multiple pinnable elements and have different versions depending on a context in which the gallery was opened.
