Systems and methods for creating near real-time embossed meshes. A system is provided for creating a preview embossed mesh for graphical display to a user. The system includes a graphical user interface device and a computer, which includes a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and a Central Processing Unit (CPU). A memory for use with the computer is configured to (a) determine a 3D volumetric mask, (b) determine a distance map corresponding to the 3D volumetric mask, and (c) render offset geometry. The GPU is used to compute the distance map within the 3D volumetric mask. The distance map and the 3D volumetric mask are accessible by a shader to provide a preview embossed mesh for graphical display. The system also includes a video display to graphically display the preview embossed mesh to the user.
