System and method for updating data in CRM. Systems and methods for processing user requests for updating data in a CRM system. When a user requests to update data in the CRM system, it is determined if the requested data change involves a DCR-controlled field. If yes, the requested data change may be routed to the MDM system for validation first and the data change may not be used to update the CRM until the validation is successful. If the requested data change does not involve any DCR-controlled field, it may update the CRM immediately.
