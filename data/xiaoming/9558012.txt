System boot with external media. Various aspects of the present disclosure provide for a system that is able to boot from a variety of media that can be connected to the system, including SPI NOR and SPI NAND memory, universal serial bus (&#x201c;USB&#x201d;) devices, and devices attached via PCIe and Ethernet interfaces. When the system is powered on, the system processor is held in a reset mode, while a microcontroller in the system identifies an external device to be booted, and then copies a portion of boot code from the external device to an on-chip memory. The microcontroller can then direct the reset vector to the boot code in the on-chip memory and brings the system processor out of reset. The system processor can execute the boot code in-place on the on-chip memory, which initiates the system memory and the second stage boot loader.
