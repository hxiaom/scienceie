Multi condition takeoff in construction project software programs. A method and system for simultaneously performing takeoff of multiple building conditions in a construction project software program is disclosed. The method comprises selecting two or more building conditions and moving a pointer to a construction drawing to select an area to perform takeoff of the multiple building conditions on. Once the area has been selected, the method and system automatically creates one or more live objects on the selected area for each of the selected building conditions and simultaneously quantifies each of the selected building conditions based on the size of the selected area.
