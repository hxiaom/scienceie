Forming a protection domain in a storage architecture. In one aspect, a method includes generating a plurality of protection domains of software-defined storage, generating a volume in each protection domain and exposing the volumes as devices in a storage architecture which generates a RAID protection over the exposed volumes. In another aspect, an apparatus includes electronic hardware circuitry configured to generate a plurality of protection domains of software-defined storage, generate a volume in each protection domain and expose the volumes as devices in a storage architecture which generates a RAID protection over the exposed volumes. In a further aspect, an article includes a non-transitory computer-readable medium that stores computer-executable instructions. The instructions cause a machine to generate a plurality of protection domains of software-defined storage, generate a volume in each protection domain and expose the volumes as devices in a storage architecture which generates a RAID protection over the exposed volumes.
