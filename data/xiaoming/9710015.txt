Wearable computer system. A wearable computer system that provides for convenient and efficient use of all fingers while the user is standing, reclining or using hands intermittently for other tasks. The central unit hangs from a neck strap and communicates with a head mounted display. The central unit's front surface has keys, accessible from opposite edges by each hand. Typing is similar to the traditional, but rotated 90 degrees on each side. Keys are individually assignable to any letter, symbol, musical note, color, action, or macro. Back panels have thumb keys and controls, and can be modified to accept alternate thumb controls and additional hardware, such as sensors, circuits, cameras, and auxiliary connectors for specific tasks such as musical instrument performance or augmented reality game play. Smartphones, can be incorporated within or connected to the central unit. Desktop use can be accomplished by unfolding the panels of one embodiment.
