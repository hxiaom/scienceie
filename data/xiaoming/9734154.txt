Method and apparatus for storing a data file. Implementations relate to storing a data file in data storages. In some implementations, a method for storing a data file in n data storages includes dividing the data file into data file parts such that at least nâ1 data file parts are equal in size, and for each nâ1 data file part, combining the nâ1 data file parts by XOR to obtain a first data file result. The method deranges the first data file result and combines each of nâ2 data file parts of the nâ1 data file parts and the deranged first data file result by XOR to obtain second data file results. The method combines the first data file result and the second data file results by XOR to obtain a third data file result, and stores each of the first, second and third data file results in one of the n data storages.
