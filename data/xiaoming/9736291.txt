Mobile device pairing. Systems and methods for pairing electronic devices are provided. In an example embodiment, first motion capture data corresponding to a physical user motion is received from a first device. Second motion capture data corresponding to the physical user motion is received from a second device. Features are extracted from the first motion capture data and the second motion capture data. An association between the first device and the second device is determined based on a comparison of the extracted features. In response to identifying the association between the first and second device, a communicative coupling between the first device and the second device is initiated.
