Touching display panel and display device using the same. A touching display panel and a display device using the same are provided. The touching display panel includes a liquid crystal layer, a first substrate having a hard surface structure, a second substrate, a touch sensor layer, a thin-film transistor layer, and a color filter layer. The first and second substrates are respectively disposed at two sides of the liquid crystal layer. The touch sensor layer is disposed between the first substrate and the liquid crystal layer, and is formed on the first substrate. The thin-film transistor layer and the color filter layer are both disposed between the first substrate and the second substrate. At least one of the thin-film transistor layer and the color filter layer is formed on the first substrate.
