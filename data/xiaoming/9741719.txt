Methods, structures, and designs for self-aligning local interconnects used in integrated circuits. An integrated circuit includes a gate electrode level region that includes a plurality of linear-shaped conductive structures. Each of the plurality of linear-shaped conductive structures is defined to extend lengthwise in a first direction. Some of the plurality of linear-shaped conductive structures form one or more gate electrodes of corresponding transistor devices. A local interconnect conductive structure is formed between two of the plurality of linear-shaped conductive structures so as to extend in the first direction along the two of the plurality of linear-shaped conductive structures.
