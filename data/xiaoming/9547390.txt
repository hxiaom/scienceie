Touch screen display device with in-set signal controller. A touch screen display device is discussed. The device uses common electrodes, which are formed for display images, as touch electrodes. In a display interval, the common electrodes receive a common voltage and allow images to be displayed. In a touch sensing interval corresponding to a non-display interval of a single frame of plural frames, the common electrodes are driven as the touch electrodes and allow a touch position to be sensed. When the touch sensing interval is terminated, the data voltages which had been applied to the data lines before the touch sensing interval are re-applied to the data lines. As such, when a succeeding display interval starts after the touch sensing interval, the reduction of charging voltage in a pixel can be prevented or reduced. Therefore, a picture fault or an image fault can be prevented.
