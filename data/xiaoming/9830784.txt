Semantic framework for variable haptic output. Methods and apparatus organize a plurality of haptic output variations into a cohesive semantic framework that uses various information about the alert condition and trigger, application context, and other conditions to provide a system of haptic outputs that share characteristics between related events. In some embodiments, an event class or application class provides the basis for a corresponding haptic output. In some embodiments, whether an alert-salience setting is on provides the basis for adding an increased salience haptic output to the standard haptic output for the alert. In some embodiments, consistent haptics provide for branding of the associated application class, application, and/or context.
