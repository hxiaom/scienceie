Tactile switch for an electronic device. Embodiments are directed to a watch having a touch-sensitive display and a switch assembly positioned along or within an enclosure. The switch assembly includes a shaft extending into an opening of the enclosure and is configured to receive rotational and translational input. A switch, positioned within the enclosure, is configured to detect the translational input. An optical sensor, positioned within the enclosure, is configured to detect the rotational input. The watch also includes a processor positioned within the enclosure and configured to modify a graphical output of the display. The graphical output may be responsive to various inputs, including a touch input provided at the display, the translational input provided at the switch assembly, and the rotational input provided at the switch assembly.
