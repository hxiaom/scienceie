Interactive content acquisition using embedded codes. Methods and devices are provided to embed a watermark message in a multimedia content to facilitate acquisition of associated information. One such method includes obtaining a server code that is assigned by a registrar entity and identifying a particular domain name that is registered to a registrant entity. Such a server code provides a mapping to an Internet address of a metadata server that includes information associated with the content. After obtaining one or more interval code, a watermark payload is formed that includes the server code and an interval code and embedded in the content. The identifies a particular segment of the content and upon distribution of such embedded content, a query based on the server code and one interval code allows metadata associated with the content to be acquired.
