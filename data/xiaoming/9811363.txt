Predictive management of on-demand code execution. Systems and methods are described for predictively managing calls to tasks on an on-demand code execution environment. Specifically, a task profile can be utilized to predict that a call to a first task will be followed by a call to a second task. Thereafter, a virtual machine can be loaded with executable code corresponding the second task, even before the call to the second task is received. If the call to the second task is received, the task can then be executed by utilizing the previously loaded executable code, thus increasing the speed at which the second task can be executed on the on-demand code execution environment.
