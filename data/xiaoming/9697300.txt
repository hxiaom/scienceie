Graph syntax validation system and method. A graph syntax validation system, method, or computer-readable medium that receives: (i) an input graph, (ii) transformation rules, and (iii) a minimal valid graph. The system/method/computer-readable medium transforms the input graph into the minimal valid graph using the transformation rules that are comprised of source patterns and target patterns. The system/method/computer-readable medium recurrently transforms the input graph until either the input graph has been reduced to the minimal valid graph indicating that the input graph uses a valid syntax, or until it is determined that one or more transformation rules do not match the input graph indicating that the input graph uses an invalid syntax.
