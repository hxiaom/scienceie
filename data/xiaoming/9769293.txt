Slider cover for computing device. Techniques including use of a slider cover for a computing device are described. In one or more implementations, the slider cover includes a cover body and a pair of hinge assemblies secured along opposing edges of the cover body. The hinge assemblies are designed to attach to a housing for a computing device having a pair of tracks extending along opposing edges of the housing. Engagement of the tracks with the hinge assemblies forms an attachment of the housing to the slider cover designed to enable the housing and slider cover to slide relative to one another in parallel planes and the housing to pivot around a pivot axis formed by the pair of hinge assemblies. Accordingly, manipulation of the housing relative to the slider cover may occur via the hinge assemblies to assume multiple different configurations for an apparatus that includes the slider cover.
