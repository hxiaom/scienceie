Method and glucose monitoring system for monitoring individual metabolic response and for generating nutritional feedback. A system and method for monitoring individual metabolic response and for generating nutritional feedback involve monitoring of a glucose level in a qualified subject. The method comprises the step of consecutively performing a plurality of measurements of a glucose level in the qualified subject by a measuring device. In the measuring device first data corresponding to the measured glucose level is generated. This data is further transmitted to an analysis device. There, second data is generated representing at least one measure for variability of a glucose level of the subject from a time-series of glucose measurements represented by the first data. The second data is compared with reference data and a result of the comparison is further processed for generating a conclusion about nutritional quality of foodstuffs consumed by the subject and/or about a risk of long-term health complications of the subject. Finally, feedback is provided corresponding to the conclusion on an output device.
