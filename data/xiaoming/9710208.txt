System and method for visualizing relationships between a source view and a target view. A method for visualizing relationships between a source and target view includes displaying in the source view a source widget representing a source object; detecting a user interaction event for the source widget; sharing a message including a reference to or at least part of the source object; displaying in the target view a target widget representing a target object; reading by a target device that displays the target view the shared message; determining the existence of a relationship between the source and target object by looking-up in a storage the referenced or the at least part of the source object from the shared message; and updating the target view by changing the visual appearance if a relationship has been determined. The source and target object each are one of a printable object, a reprographic device or component thereof, and a property or status of any of the these.
