Determining direction of networked microphone device relative to audio playback device. Example techniques involve determining a direction of an NMD. An example implementation includes causing two audio drivers to output audio content, where the audio drivers are positioned at a known distance apart in a given azimuthal plane and recording the audio content output by the two audio drivers. The implementation also includes causing a processing device to identify a direction of the NMD relative to a center point of the two audio drivers in the given azimuthal plane. Identifying the direction of the NMD may involve determining a range of possible azimuthal angles between the NMD and the center point, the range of possible angles dependent upon the known distance between the two audio drivers and a phase offset between the two audio drivers indicated by the recorded audio content output. The implementation further includes causing a playback device to adjust calibration based on the identified direction of the NMD.
