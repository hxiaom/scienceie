Asymmetric circuitry. Techniques are disclosed relating to asymmetric circuits. In some embodiments, a storage element is configured to maintain a first input value as an input to an asymmetric circuit during a time interval. For example, in one embodiment, the time interval may correspond to a frame of video data and the storage element may be configured to store a filter coefficient for the frame of video data. In some embodiments, the storage element may be configured to store the value as a constant for multiple operations by the asymmetric circuit. In some embodiments, the asymmetric circuit is configured to generate a plurality of output values based on the first input value and respective ones of a set of second input values. In some embodiments, the asymmetric circuit is leakage power asymmetric and/or critical path asymmetric. This may increase performance and/or reduce power consumption.
