Electronic device and firmware recovery program that ensure recovery of firmware. An electronic device includes a first nonvolatile memory, a second nonvolatile memory, and a control circuit. The first nonvolatile memory includes an area to store firmware. The firmware includes a first kernel. The second nonvolatile memory includes an area to store an update program, the update program including a second kernel. The control circuit boots the one of the first and the second kernels, and ensures writing data to the first nonvolatile memory by the booted one of the first and the second kernels. When the firmware is incapable of being read, the control circuit reads the update program and performs the boot process to boot the second kernel, and writes updating data of the firmware to the first nonvolatile memory, the first nonvolatile memory being writable of the data by the booted second kernel.
