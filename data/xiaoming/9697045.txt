Selecting resource allocation policies and resolving resource conflicts. Techniques for workload management in cloud computing infrastructures are provided. In one aspect, a method for allocating computing resources in a datacenter cluster is provided. The method includes the steps of: creating multiple, parallel schedulers; and automatically selecting a resource allocation method for each of the schedulers based on one or more of a workload profile, user requirements, and a state of the datacenter cluster, wherein an optimistic resource allocation method is selected for at least a first one or more of the schedulers and a pessimistic resource allocation method is selected for at least a second one or more of the schedulers. Due to optimistic resource allocation conflicts may arise. Methods to resolve such conflicts are also provided.
