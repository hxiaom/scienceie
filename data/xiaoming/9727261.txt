Weighted programming patterns in solid-state data storage systems. Systems and methods are disclosed for programming data in non-volatile memory arrays. A data storage device includes a solid-state non-volatile memory including a plurality of memory cells and a controller configured to improve data retention or reduce read disturb of at least a portion of the solid-state non-volatile memory at least in part by receiving data to be written to the solid-state non-volatile memory. The controller is further configured to, when a data retention programming mode is set, encode the data using a programming pattern that favors a first programming state over a second programming state, the first programming state being associated with a lower voltage level than the second programming state, and write the encoded data to the solid-state non-volatile memory. When a read disturb programming mode is set, the first programming state is associated with a higher voltage level than the second programming state.
